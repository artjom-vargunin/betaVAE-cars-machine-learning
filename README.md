## β-VAE on Cars dataset - Unsupervised learning of disentangled features

This "Neural Networks" course project aimes to learn disentangled (hidden) features of the car images from the CAR196 dataset using neural network architecture of β-VAE.

The presentation of the results of the project can be found in the pdf attached or under the link
